## Instructions

### Explanation

Created with React

Styled with Semantic UI

Favicon from: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Video-Game-Controller-Icon-IDV-edit-dark.svg

Packages used: react-router-dom & dotenv

The very next feature I would work on would be implementing 'cart persistence' by storing information in a customer's cart with the universal-cookie package (installed but unused). This would allow the cart to stay populated despite refreshing or navigating away from the page.

Other features considered but not implemented:
- Creating defined areas for the header, search bar, results
- Add styling for viewports below 600px
- Ability to search by genre or decade
- Home screen with 'most popular' view
- Backend to keep track of customer orders

The API key was originally hidden in an .env file - that structure is still set up, but for ease of review I've put the key inside of an uploaded file instead.

Please contact me with any issues or questions!
